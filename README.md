**Performance Mod** is a comprehensive optimization addon for Garry's Mod designed specifically to boost FPS and improve network stability, ideally suited for modern CPUs (4 cores or more). It achieves performance gains by adjusting rendering, networking, and system-level configurations without sacrificing graphics quality or gameplay fidelity.

## **Features**:
- **FPS Boost**: Activates multi-core rendering and threading optimizations for enhanced framerates.
- **Network Optimization**: Improves connection stability and reduces lag via adjusted network settings.
- **General Optimizations**: Enhances sound handling, I/O performance, and resource management.

## **Settings Menu**:
All options can be toggled under the context menu, navigate to `Utilities → Performance Mod`.

## Compatibility:
Fully compatible with all other FPS booster addons. Conflicts are highly unlikely.

## **FAQ**

### **Does this mod support older CPUs?**
Not recommended. This mod uses multi-core settings like  
`gmod_mcore_test 1`  
`mat_queue_mode 2`  
which are designed for modern CPUs (4+ cores). On older systems, these settings can cause crashes, instability, or no performance gain.

**If your CPU has fewer than 4 logical cores, you may want to avoid using this mod.**

### **Where can I adjust the addon settings?**
In the Performance Mod settings menu accessible via the context menu, navigate to `Utilities → Performance Mod`.

### **Does this work with other FPS booster mods?**
Yes, fully compatible with all other FPS booster mods available in the workshop.

### **My game crashed or froze after installation; what happened?**
This mod won't normally cause crashes unless you're using a CPU with fewer than 4 cores. If a crash occurs unexpectedly, please report it with your system specs and a description of the issue.

### **Does this addon improve multiplayer performance?**
Yes, provided the server host has this addon installed, players should experience improved network performance and reduced lag.

### **I don't notice significant performance gains, why?**
The effectiveness varies based on hardware specifications and installed addons. Users with extremely high addon counts or weaker hardware might notice smaller performance improvements.
